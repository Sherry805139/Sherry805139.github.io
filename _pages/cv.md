## Research Experience

- **Evolving Personalized GUI Agent with Privacy-preserving GUI Hub** — Research Intern (Advisor: Prof. Ying Wei), Aug 2025 – Present  
  - Lead development of a privacy-preserving LoRA hub framework to reconcile personalization with data privacy in GUI agents (targeting a top-tier conference submission).
  - Designed and implemented a multimodal weighting algorithm to compute similarity between user queries and LoRA training datasets’ embeddings (addressing limitations of text-only retrieval).
  - Built the experimental pipeline using FedMABench; trained category-level and app-level LoRAs to validate retrieval logic.
  - Engineering a Differential Privacy (DP) mechanism to inject noise during weight fusion to reduce leakage of user-specific data.

- **AI for Story Generation** — Undergraduate Researcher (with Ph.D. candidates), Aug 2025  
  - Conducted literature review on story generation benchmarks for a Human-AI Interaction project targeting CHI.
  - Contributed to an interactive story generation system, focusing on improving alignment between user intent and LLM-generated narratives.
